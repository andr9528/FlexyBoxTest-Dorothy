Patterns i know that i make use of, or specificly allow support for. There are very likely more patterns used than listed below.

- Microservice Architecture
- Proxy Pattern
- Singleton Pattern

Patterns missing form the above list, are with high probability pattersn, I don't notice making use of, as i might have used that way of developing for a long time.

In general remember to read the summaries added to methods, classes and interface, as they might describe why i have done a specific thing.
Due to the use of my previously created code, found in Wolf.Utility.Core, This Development Test, was made easier, as i could reuse alot of my code.
This support the pricip DRY (Don't repeat yourself), which i like, as it lowers the amount of code that needs to be maintained, and increases code that can be reused.
